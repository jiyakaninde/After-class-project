    <h1>BUTTERFLIES</h1>
    <img src="download.jfif">
    <p id="p1">butterfly, (superfamily Papilionoidea), any of numerous species of insects belonging to multiple families. Butterflies,
    along with the moths and the skippers, make up the insect order Lepidoptera. Butterflies are nearly worldwide in their
    distribution.
</p>
<p id="p2">The wings, bodies, and legs, like those of moths, are covered with dustlike scales that come off when the animal is
handled. Unlike moths, butterflies are active during the day and are usually brightly coloured or strikingly patterned.
Perhaps the most distinctive physical features of the butterfly are its club-tipped antennae and its habit of holding
the wings vertically over the back when at rest. The lepidopteran life cycle has four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar),
pupa (chrysalis), and adult (imago). The larvae and adults of most butterflies feed on plants, often only specific parts
of specific types of plants.</p>
<h2>Life Cycle of a Butterfly</h2>
<p id="p3"> The butterfly and moth develop through a process called metamorphosis. This is a Greek word that means transformation or
change in shape.

Insects have two common types of metamorphosis. Grasshoppers, crickets, dragonflies, and cockroaches have incomplete
metamorphosis. The young (called a nymph) usually look like small adults but without the wings.

Butterflies, moths, beetles, flies and bees have complete metamorphosis. The young (called a larva instead of a nymph)
is very different from the adults. It also usually eats different types of food.

There are four stages in the metamorphosis of butterflies and moths: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.</p>
<h3>The Egg</h3><br><br>
<p id="p4">Eggs are laid on plants by the adult female butterfly. These plants will then become the food for the hatching
caterpillars.

Eggs can be laid from spring, summer or fall. This depends on the species of butterfly. Females lay a lot of eggs at
once so that at least some of them survive.

Butterfly eggs can be very small.</p>
<h3>Caterpillar: the feeding stage</h3><br><br>
<P id="p5">The next stage is the larva. This is also called a caterpillar if the insect is a butterfly or a moth.

The job of the caterpillar is to eat and eat and eat. As the caterpillar grows it splits its skin and sheds it about 4
or 5 times. Food eaten at this time is stored and used later as an adult.

Caterpillars can grow 100 times their size during this stage. For example, a monarch butterfly egg is the size of a
pinhead and the caterpillar that hatches from this tiny egg isn't much bigger. But it will grow up to 2 inches long in
several weeks.</P>
<h3>Pupa</h3><br><br>
<p id="p6">When the caterpillar is full grown and stops eating, it becomes a pupa. The pupa of butterflies is also called a
chrysalis.

Depending on the species, the pupa may suspended under a branch, hidden in leaves or buried underground. The pupa of
many moths is protected inside a coccoon of silk.

This stage can last from a few weeks, a month or even longer. Some species have a pupal stage that lasts for two years.

It may look like nothing is going on but big changes are happening inside. Special cells that were present in the larva
are now growing rapidly. They will become the legs, wings, eyes and other parts of the adult butterfly. Many of the
original larva cells will provide energy for these growing adult cells.</p>
<h3>Adult</h3><br><br>
<p id="p7">The adult stage is what most people think of when they think of butterflies. They look very different from the larva.
The caterpillar has a few tiny eyes, stubby legs and very short antennae. The adults have long legs, long antennae, and
compound eyes. They can also fly by using their large and colorful wings. The one thing they can't do is grow.

The caterpillar's job was to eat. The adult's job is to mate and lay eggs. Some species of adult butterflies get energy
by feeding on nectar from flowers but many species don't feed at all.

Flying comes in handy. The adult female can easily fly from place to place to find the right plant for its eggs. This is
important because caterpillars can't travel far.

Most adult butterflies live only one or two weeks, but some species hibernate during the winter and may live several
months.</p>
<p>Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often brightly
coloured wings that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the
superfamilies Hedyloidea (moth-butterflies in the Americas) and Papilionoidea (all others). The oldest butterfly fossils
have been dated to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago, though molecular evidence suggets they likely originated
in the Cretaceous.[1]

Butterflies have a four-stage life cycle, and like other holometabolous insects they undergo complete metamorphosis.[2]
Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed. The caterpillars grow,
sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin
splits, the adult insect climbs out, expands its wings to dry, and flies off.

Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation,
and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.[3]

Butterflies are often polymorphic, and many species make use of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism to evade their
predators.[4] Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many butterflies are attacked by
parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other
organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species
are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few
are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular
motif in the visual and literary arts. The Smithsonian Institution says "butterflies are certainly one of the most
appealing creatures in nature".[5]</p>
