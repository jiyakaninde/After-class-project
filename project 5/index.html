    <p>cat, (Felis catus), domesticated member (felid) of the family Felidae. The family is generally divided between cats from
    the subfamily Pantherinae, which roar (including lions, tigers, and leopards), and cats from the subfamily Felinae,
    which purr instead (including cougars, bobcats, and domestic cats). According to the latest research, purring likely
    stems from a special pad within the folds of a catâ€™s vocal cords, which adds an additional layer of fatty tissue that
    enables the folds to vibrate (purr) at low frequencies. Domestic cats are characterized by retractable claws, powerful
    bodies, acute senses, long tails, and specialized teeth adapted for hunting prey.</p>
