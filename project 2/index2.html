<p> <b>Springfields School of Education</b> is a school community with a mission. Our great desire is to provide international
education to all the students of Zambia at an affordable fee without compromising the quality of our education.
Education is still a luxury than a right in most parts of the world and especially good education offering international
qualification is a privilege very few would enjoy.We want to contribute to the community and the world at large by
providing our students opportunities to learn and seek wisdom. <del>It is located in India.</del></p>
