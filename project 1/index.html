    <title> The Beauty of Art </title>
</head>
<body>Art is a quite fascinating thing, being able to capture beauty of your surrounding on to paper. It is like magic, a powerful illusion created by hands.<br> It is what i like doing in my spare time, draw. I like how when i draw it is just my skill and the music i put on against the harsh reality. Even though, i am yet to do better as others, i like how it calms me and fills me with passion.</body>
