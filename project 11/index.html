<h2>FACTS ABOUT RED PANDAS</h2>
    <p>The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also known as the lesser panda, is a small mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and
    southwestern China. It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, white-lined ears, a mostly white muzzle
    and a ringed tail. Its head-to-body length is 51–63.5 cm (20.1–25.0 in) with a 28–48.5 cm (11.0–19.1 in) tail, and it
    weighs between 3.2 and 15 kg (7.1 and 33.1 lb). It is well adapted to climbing due to its flexible joints and curved
    semi-retractile claws.</p>
