    <h1>Tangled</h1>
<h2>Biography of Rapunzal</h2>
<p id="rr">Rapunzel is a fictional character in Disney's animated film Tangled (2010).</p><p class="re"> Based on the title character from the
Brothers Grimm fairy tale of the same name, Rapunzel is a young princess kept unaware of her royal lineage by Mother</p>
<p class="re">Gothel, a vain woman who kidnaps her as a baby to hoard her hair's healing powers and remain young forever. Raised in a
secluded tower, Rapunzel escapes with a wanted thief who promises to help her see the elusive floating lights in time
for her 18th birthday, in exchange for a crown she has hidden from him. She is voiced by actress and singer Mandy Moore.</p>

<p id="hi">Created and animated by supervising animator Glen Keane, the character was adapted into a less passive heroine for the
film by removing her from the confines of the tower. The character was originally to have been voiced by actresses
Kristen Chenoweth and Reese Witherspoon, who eventually left the project and were replaced by Moore. Keane based her
personality and interests on those of his own daughter, specifically painting. Special software was used to animate
Rapunzel's 75-feet of long hair.</p>

<p id="pr">Critical reception of Rapunzel has been generally positive, with critics complimenting her spirited, lively personality
and independence. The tenth Disney Princess, Rapunzel was officially inducted into the line-up on October 2, 2011,
becoming the franchise's first computer-animated member and the first European princess in 20 years, the last being
Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991). Her appearance and personality have drawn much comparison between her and one of
the preceding Disney Princesses, Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), by whom she was inspired.</p>
